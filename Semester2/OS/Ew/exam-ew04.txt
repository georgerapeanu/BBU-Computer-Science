It is not certain what the threads will print. The output will be one of 10 numbers, each between 0 and 9(not necessarily distinct), but the order and exact value of them is not certain. This is because the threads get the address of i as a parameter, but i is increased during the for. Thus, we cannot determine what happens: maybe i is increased a couple of times before printed by a thread, or maybe multiple threads print the same i. Maybe a thread that read the value of i at some point waits, and another thread gets to print a bigger i before the current thread can print that value.
