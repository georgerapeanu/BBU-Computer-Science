EN: How is the address calculation done in the absolute fixed partition allocation?

Raspundeti mai jos/Write your answer below:

In absolute fixed partition allocation, there is a number of predefined partitions in the RAM that can be used by a program.
This number of partitions is fixed, and a program is compiled for a certain partition.

This means that the final executable address of a variable in the RAM is known at compile time, so the address in the binary is the same with the final address in the executable. So, Binary address = Physical address. At compile time, the program uses the address of the start of the partition it is compiled for in order to determine its exact final address
