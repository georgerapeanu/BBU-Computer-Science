EN: Given two set-associative caches, one with 2 sets of 4 pages and one with 4 sets of 2 pages, which would perform better for the sequence of page requests below? Justify your answer.

    17, 2, 37, 6, 9

We have 2 caches. Using set-associative caches, in order to place a page in cache, we first take the page number modulo number of groups, and then we look for a spot in that group.

First one with 2 sets of 4 pages. Lets say pages 0,1,2,3 are in set 0, pages 4,5,6,7 are in set 1.
17 mod 2 = 1 -> it could go on page 4
2 mod 2 = 0 -> it could go on page 0
37 mod 2 = 1 -> it could go on page 5
6 mod 2 = 0 -> it could go on page 1
9 mod 2 = 1 -> it could go on page 6

The second one has 4 sets of 2 pages. Lets say pages 0,1 are in set 0; pages 2,3 are in set 1; pages 4,5 are in set 2; pages 6,7 are in set 3;

17 mod 4 = 1 -> it could go on page 2
2 mod 4 = 2 -> it could go on page 4
37 mod 4 = 1 -> it could go on page 3
6 mod 4 = 2 -> it could go on page 5
9 mod 4 = 1 -> both pages in this group are full, so the cache would be force to offload a page

Thus, I think the first cache would perform better for this pages, since it does not need to move a cache page back to ram in order to load one from RAM.
