Write 2 c programs, A and B. A will create 2 prcesses p1 and p2. p1 will
have provided (by any means (necessary)) a file containing only numbers (as
many as you like) then it will read from the standard input (keyboard)
a number (n). p1 will send the first n numbers from the file to p2 via pipe.
p2 will send the sum of al the even numbers received to B, via fifo.
B will display on the standard output (the console) the number received.
The fifo file must be created within the programs.
The source file must be compiled using gcc with -Wall -g options WITHOUT WARNINGS OR SYNTAX ERRORS!!!
Memory leacks and zombie processes are not allowed.
