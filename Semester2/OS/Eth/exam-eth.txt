Write a c program that receives pairs of integer numbers as command line
arguments. The secound number in the pair reprezents an index between 0 and
the total number of pairs, all te indexes given will be unique.
For each pair the program will create a thread, each thread will be indexed
starting from 0 in the order in which they are created. Each thread will
receive as argument one of the pairs given as command line argument. Each
thread will add to an integer global variable the value o the first number
of the pair it received as command line argument. If the global variable is
an even number after the addition the next thread that will add to the
variable will be the thread with the index equal to the index received by
the las thread that added to the variable, othrewise any othre thread can
add to the gobal variable.
The execution will end after the gobal variable ecides a predetermined value.
The threads must be dynamically allocated in memory.
The access to the critical resources must be efficiently synchronized (aka
the wait time of each thread must be miminum)
NOTE: When you compile use the -pthread obtion.
The source file must be compiled using gcc with -Wall -g options WITHOUT WARNINGS OR SYNTAX ERRORS!!!
