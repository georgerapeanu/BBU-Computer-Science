\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Each student will be given one of the problems below.
\item The solution must use the {\bfseries{C language}}.
\item The problem should be solved over 2 iterations, due {\ttfamily Week 3} and {\ttfamily Week 4}\+:
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsubsection{Week 3}\label{md_README_autotoc_md2}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Solve at least requirements {\bfseries{a}} and {\bfseries{b}}.
\item The vector used in the repository can be statically allocated.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsubsection{Week 4}\label{md_README_autotoc_md3}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Solve all problem requirements.
\item Define a vector structure with specific operations using a dynamically allocated array.
\item Use modular programming.
\item Source code must be specified and include tests for all non-\/\+UI functions
\item The program must not leak memory!
\item Use a layered architecture for your application (domain, repository, controller, UI). User interface, domain and data access elements will be stored in different modules. The user interface module will only contain the user interface part.
\item Have at least 10 entries available at application startup.
\item Handle user input errors gracefully (replace program crashes with nice error messages \+:blush\+:).
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsection{Bonus possibilities}\label{md_README_autotoc_md4}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Implement the following requirements using function pointers {\bfseries{\mbox{[}deadline\+: week 4, bonus\+: 0.\+1p\mbox{]}}}\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item For requirement {\bfseries{b}}, add a different type of filtering (of your choice).
\item For requirement {\bfseries{c}}, add descending sorting. The user should choose the type of sort and the program will show the list of entities accordingly.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Provide 2 different implementations for the undo\+\_\+operation/redo\+\_\+operation functionality\+: one using a list of operations (this approach is a precursor of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern}{\texttt{ Command design pattern}}) and one where each state of the repository is recorded (this approach is not unlike the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_pattern}{\texttt{ Memento design pattern}}). Implement your dynamic array generically, such that it can contain any type of elements (use void$\ast$). Use this structure for your repository, as well as to implement both undo\+\_\+operation/redo\+\_\+operation functionalities {\bfseries{\mbox{[}deadline\+: week 5, bonus\+: 0.\+1p\mbox{]}}}.

Each {\bfseries{Medicine}} has the following attributes\+: {\ttfamily name}, {\ttfamily concentration}, {\ttfamily quantity} and {\ttfamily price}. John wants the application to help him in the following ways\+:\textbackslash{} $\ast$$\ast$(a)$\ast$$\ast$ Add, delete or update a medicine.

Mary runs her family\textquotesingle{}s bakery, {\itshape “\+Bread\textquotesingle{}n Bagel”}. Every day she struggles with keeping up to date with available stocks of raw materials and would like a program to help her manage the business more effectively. Each {\bfseries{Material}} used in the bakery must have\+: a {\ttfamily name}, a {\ttfamily supplier}, a {\ttfamily quantity} and the {\ttfamily expiration date}. Mary wants a software application that helps her in the following ways\+:\textbackslash{} $\ast$$\ast$(a)$\ast$$\ast$ Add, delete and update a material. A raw material is uniquely identified by its name, supplier and expiration date. If a material that already exists is added, its quantity will be modified (the new quantity is added to the existing one).\textbackslash{} $\ast$$\ast$(b)$\ast$$\ast$ See all available materials past their expiration date, containing a given string (if the string is empty, all materials past their expiration date will be considered).\textbackslash{} $\ast$$\ast$(c)$\ast$$\ast$ Display all materials from a given supplier, which are in short supply (quantity less than a user-\/provided value), sorted ascending by their quantities.\textbackslash{} $\ast$$\ast$(d)$\ast$$\ast$ Provide multiple undo\+\_\+operation and redo\+\_\+operation functionality.

The company {\itshape “\+Home Smart\+Apps”} have decided to design a new intelligent refrigerator. Besides the hardware, they need a software application to manage the refrigerator. Each {\bfseries{Product}} that the fridge can store has a {\ttfamily name}, a {\ttfamily category} (one of {\ttfamily dairy, sweets, meat or fruit}), a {\ttfamily quantity} and an {\ttfamily expiration date}. The software application will provide the following functionalities\+:\textbackslash{} $\ast$$\ast$(a)$\ast$$\ast$ Add, delete or update a product.
