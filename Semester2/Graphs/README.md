## This directory contains the work I did for the Graphs course.

The course was about graphs and graph-related algorithms.

Some relevant topics discussed were:
* Graphs representations
* DFS and BFS
* Dijkstra's algorithm
* Directed acyclic graphs
* Trees
* Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree.
* Ford-Fulkerson for finding the Maximum Flow.
