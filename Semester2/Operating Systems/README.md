## This directory contains the work I did for the Operating Systems course.

The course was about studying how an Operating System works using Linux as an example.

Some relevant topics discussed were:
* Using grep, sed, awk
* Shell scripts
* Processes
* Interprocess communication: pipes, FIFOs, Shared Memory
* Threads and thread syncronization mechanisms: mutex, semaphore, barrier, read-write lock
* OS process management, process scheduling
* Memory allocation policies
* Process Loading policies
* Memory Replacement policies
* Memory Placement policies
* Cache memory
* Filesystems
