A delay of 0 is impossible. If any task is scheduled before C, then C has a starting time that is a list 3, so it has a finishing time that is at least 6 > 5. If it is scheduled first, then we either schedule B, which would finish at 13 and thus A would have a (big) delay, either A, which would finish at 6, and then B would finish at 16(with a delay of 1).

So, a delay of 1 is the best option, and one of the ways of obtaining it is scheduling the tasks in the order:

C, A, B

Task C would start at 0 and finish at 3(<= 5 so 0 delay), Task A would start at 3 and finish at 6(<=8 so 0 delay), and task B would start at 6 and finish at 16(=15+1 so 1 delay).
