## This directory contains the work I did for the Dynamical Systems course.

The course was an introductory course to Ordinary Differential Equations.

Some relevant topics discussed were:
* Linear homogeneus differential equations.
* Linear non-homogeneus differential equations
* Planar Systems
* Linear difference equations
* Newton's method
* Euler's method
* Equilibrium points, attractors, repellers
* Flow of a dynamical system
* Level curves
