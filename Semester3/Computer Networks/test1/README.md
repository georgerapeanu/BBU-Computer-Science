Implement the following location-guessing game using TCP sockets. The server generates a random pair of coordinates in a plane. You can assume the coordinates are in the range 0..100 and are of integer type. Three clients connect to the server and each of them generates a random point in the XY plane (the same range 0..100) and sends these coordinates to the server. After all clients have sent their guess, the server decides which was closest to its initial coordinates and echoes back to the clients either “You won!” or “You lost!”. Finally, the clients and the server should gracefully shut down. You can implement in your programming language of choice (C++/Python).
