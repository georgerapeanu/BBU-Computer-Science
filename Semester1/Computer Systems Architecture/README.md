## This directory contains the work I did for the Computer Systems Architecture course.

The course was about understanding how a computer operates on a lower-level and studying the x86 architecture for 32 bits. 

Some relevant topics discussed were:
* Von Neumann architecture
* x86 basic instruction set
* What happens at assembly/compile time, linking and loading time
* Multi-module programming, asm + asm and asm + C.
