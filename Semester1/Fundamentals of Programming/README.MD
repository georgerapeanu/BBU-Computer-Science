## This directory contains the work I did for the Fundamentals of Programming course.

The course was an introductory course to programming using Python.

Some relevant topics discussed were:
* Functional and Object Oriented Programming
* Layered architecture(UI/Service/Repository/Domain)
* Persistent storage(utilising File Repositories and Binary Repositories with pickle)
