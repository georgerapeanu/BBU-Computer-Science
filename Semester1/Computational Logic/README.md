## This directory contains the work I did for the Computational Logic course.

The course was about propositional, predicate logic and boolean logic.

Some relevant topics discussed were:
* Refutation and direct proof methods
* Lock resolution
* Semantic tablaux
* Veitch-Karnaugh diagram
* Quine's metod
* Moisil's method
